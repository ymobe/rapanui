2) Copy config.lua from rapanui directory under your project
3) Add a require "config" into your main.lua
4) Add a require "rapanui-sdk.rapanui" into your main.lua

Now your main.lua should look something like this

Example .bat file (in this example Moai distribution is under C:\moai-sdk directory):

"C:\moai-sdk\bin\win32\moai.exe"
"C:\moai-sdk\samples\config\config.lua" 
"main.lua"

4)Now run the .bat file you've just created.
